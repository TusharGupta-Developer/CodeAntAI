# Frontend Developer Assignment - CodeAnt AI

This repository contains the frontend implementation of the design provided in the Figma file as part of the Frontend Developer Intern assignment for CodeAnt AI. The project showcases a responsive and functional user interface built using **ReactJS, HTML, and CSS**, utilizing **CSS variables** and adhering to best practices for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: For building the UI components and managing state.
- **React Router**: For seamless navigation between different sections of the application.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- **Vite**: For a fast and optimized development experience.

## 🎨 Features
- Fully functional and responsive UI implementation based on the [Figma design](#figma-design-link).
- Utilization of **CSS variables** for consistent and reusable styling.
- Clean, maintainable, and scalable code structure.
- Adherence to best practices for performance and usability.
- Seamless responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices.
- Implementation of interactive and user-friendly components.
- **React Router** for intuitive navigation between pages.

# 🗺️ React Router Integration

The application uses **React Router** for page navigation. Here's how the routing is implemented:

## Example Routes:
- `/` : Home page  
- `/signin` : SignIn page   

### Sample Routing Code in `App.jsx`:
```jsx
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Layout from "./components/Layout/Layout";
import Repositories from "./pages/Home/repositories";
import SignIn from "./pages/SignIn/SignIn";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={<Repositories />} />  {/* Default child route */}
          <Route path="signin" element={<SignIn />} />
          {/* <Route path="contact" element={<ContactPage />} /> */}
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

export default App;
```
